# Toms Mobs

**This Serverside Fabric mod brings a small collection of new mobs to your server, all without any additional downloads required by players.**

It runs entirely server-side, from resourcepack generation to distribution using polymer autohost.
Players wont have to download any mods, they can join with vanilla clients!

## Setup:

Install this mod on your server together with:
- [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer)
- [Fabric-API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)

The server automatically generates a resource pack using the blockbench-import-library and provides it to the clients via polymer's autohost functionality.

Check out the setup to automatically share the resourcepack here [https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/)

The entities are available under the namespace `toms_mobs` (`toms_mobs:elephant`, etc.)
